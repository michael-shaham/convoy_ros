# Convoy ROS

This is a ROS package for controlling both simulated and real one-tenth scale 
vehicles that will be used to test and evaluate convoy algorithms.

We will be using ROS2 for this project. For now, we will use the Foxy 
distribution. See the `docs` folder for various resources on vehicle setup, 
running the simulator, network setup, and more.

This work corresponds to the paper titled "Design and realization of a 
benchmarking testbed for evaluating autonomous platooning algorithms" which 
was accepted to ISER 2023.
