# Convoy ROS

This is a ROS package for controlling both simulated and real one-tenth scale 
vehicles that will be used to test and evaluate convoy algorithms.

We will be using ROS2 for this project. For now, we will use the Foxy 
distribution. See the `docs` folder for various resources on vehicle setup, 
running the simulator, network setup, and more.

This work corresponds to the paper titled "Distributed model predictive control 
for heterogeneous platoons with affine spacing policies and arbitrary 
communication topologies" which was submitted to ITSC 2024. Paper link will be 
provided in the future.

Some of the code/info might be slightly disorganized, but please reach out 
if you have any issues with anything in this code base.
