# Teleop information

`human_control/teleop` button: `L1`

`autonomous_control` button: `R1`

Note that these buttons act as a dead man's switch, i.e., if you let go of the 
button, the robot (should) stop. The left joystick is used for controlling the 
vehicle.

For teleop, the left joystick (up/down) controls the speed and the right 
joystick (left/right) controls the steering angle.
