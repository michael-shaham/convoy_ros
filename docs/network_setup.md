# Network setup

Connect to the RIVeR-convoy network (password is `convoyTF!40`).

To access the router's settings, go to http://192.168.1.1 and use the username 
`admin` and password `convoyTF!40`. Go to `Advanced` then `Setup` then 
`LAN Setup` to set static IP addresses.

The vehicles will be numbered in order starting from 100, i.e., the first 
vehicle we set up will have IP address 192.168.1.100. Computers that are given 
static IP addresses will start at 200. So far, Michael's MacBook Air is
192.168.1.200 and the RIVeR-Patapsco desktop is 192.168.1.201.
